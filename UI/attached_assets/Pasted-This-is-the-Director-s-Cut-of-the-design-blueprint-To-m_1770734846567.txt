This is the "Director’s Cut" of the design blueprint. To make this feel like a premium enterprise tool, we need to focus on micro-interactions—the small animations and feedback loops that tell Sarah the system is working hard so she doesn't have to.

🎨 Part 1: Detailed Designer’s Blueprint (UX/UI)
1. The Layout Architecture (The "Golden Ratio" Grid)
The Container: A fixed-height viewport (100vh) to prevent awkward scrolling. Use a Glassmorphism effect for cards (semi-transparent backgrounds with a 1px border) to maintain that "high-tech" feel.

The Transition: When moving from Phase 1 to Phase 2, use a "Vertical Accordion" or "Shift & Dim" logic.

Phase 1: The 3 Agent Columns take 80% of the screen.

Phase 2: The Agent Columns shrink to the top 30% of the screen (becoming a "Summary Row"), and the Smoking Gun Panel slides up from the bottom to take the remaining 70%.

2. The Header: "Command & Control"
Three-Way Input: Instead of one big box, use three distinct input fields with a "Link" icon.

Default State: Fields are auto-populated with context from the PagerDuty alert.

The Pulse: The Health Badge shouldn't just be static; it should have a subtle 2-second "heartbeat" glow to reassure a tired engineer that the connection is live.

The Trigger Button: * Normal: bg-blue-600 with a "Shield" icon.

Loading: An outer ring rotates while the inner text pulses "Parsing Data...".

Success: Momentarily turns green with a checkmark before resetting.

3. Phase 1: The "Parallel Investigation" Grid
Agent Identity Badges:

GitHub Agent: Neon Purple border. Icon: GitBranch.

AWS Agent: Safety Orange border. Icon: Server.

Slack Agent: Slack-brand Green border. Icon: MessageSquare.

The Stream Interaction:

Auto-Scroll Lock: A small "Lock" icon at the bottom of the stream. If Sarah manually scrolls up to read something, the auto-scroll should pause and the icon should turn amber.

The Tool Drawer (Micro-UI): Tool pills shouldn't just appear; they should "pop" in with a bounce.

Label: GET_LOGS or SEARCH_COMMITS.

On Click: Instead of a basic modal, use a Slide-over Panel from the right so Sarah doesn't lose sight of the other two agents.

Completion State: When an agent finishes, the card's border should stop pulsing and settle into a solid, subtle glow.

4. Phase 2: The "Smoking Gun" (Reasoning Investigator)
The Hero Header: A large, bold title: CRITICAL FINDING: DEPLOYMENT #3847.

The Evidence Timeline: Instead of a wall of text, use a vertical line connecting the findings.

Node 1 (AWS): "Spike detected at 2:47 AM."

Node 2 (GitHub): "PR #12 merged at 2:45 AM."

Conclusion: "Race condition identified in auth_controller.py."

The Action Zone: At the bottom of this panel, place two distinct buttons:

Primary: Rollback Deployment (High contrast, red-to-orange gradient).

Secondary: Mute Alert & Continue Monitoring.

5. The Sidebar: "The Analysis Vault"
Future Utility: This is where "Artifacts" live.

PDF Generation Visual: A vertical progress bar that fills up as Phase 1 and Phase 2 complete.

Skeleton States: Use shimmering gray boxes to represent the PDF page previews. This gives the user the feeling that a formal document is being "authored" in the background.
